Since I'm barely developing these anymore, I decided to release the source for people to view\change. Everything is at a compilable state, read on for build instruction.

HaRepacker is complete. HaCreator is not (it compiles and works, but it's missing saving and the code needs to be organized)

In order to build HaRepacker you need absolutely nothing except for Microsoft's C# programming tools.

In order to build HaCreator you also need:
a.DotNetBar 9.0
b.XNA Game Studio 4

The WZ library I used is not included, you can get it from its own project at http://code.google.com/p/maplelib2/
The APNG library I used is only included as binaries, to download its source go to http://code.google.com/p/sharpapng/
